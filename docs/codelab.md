## **Page 1: Overview**

### **What is Being Built?**
This project demonstrates the creation of a **cryptocurrency data pipeline** that extracts data from the YFinance API, stores it in AWS S3, processes it in Snowflake using Snowpark Python, and automates workflows with Airflow and Snowflake Tasks. The pipeline also includes CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions and environment management using Jinja templates.

### **Key Features**
- **Data Extraction**: Fetch cryptocurrency data using YFinance API.
- **Data Storage**: Store raw data in AWS S3 and ingest it into Snowflake.
- **Data Transformation**: Use Snowpark Python for harmonization and transformation.
- **Analytics**: Build pre-computed analytics tables for insights.
- **Automation**: Orchestrate workflows with Snowflake Tasks and Airflow.
- **Testing & Validation**: Unit tests for UDFs and stored procedures.
- **Environment Management**: Manage configurations with Jinja templates.

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.8+ installed (`python --version`)
- AWS account with S3 access
- Snowflake account with appropriate privileges
- GitHub repository setup
- Airflow environment (local or cloud)
- VSCode with Python extensions installed

### **What You Will Need**
1. Python libraries:
   - `yfinance`, `pandas`, `snowflake-connector-python`, `boto3`, `apache-airflow`
2. AWS CLI configured for S3 access
3. Snowflake CLI or Python connector for database interactions
4. GitHub Actions setup for CI/CD
5. Jinja templates for environment management

### **Step-by-Step Setup Instructions**

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Configure AWS S3**
<!-- Add detailed instructions on creating an S3 bucket, setting up IAM roles, and configuring AWS CLI -->

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Snowflake**
<!-- Add detailed instructions on setting up a Snowflake account, creating warehouses, databases, schemas, and granting necessary permissions -->

## **Page 3: Data Ingestion**

### **Summary**
In this step, we will extract cryptocurrency data from the YFinance API and store it as a CSV file in an AWS S3 bucket. This forms the foundation of the pipeline by providing raw data for further processing.

#### **Steps to Implement**
1. Use the YFinance API to fetch historical cryptocurrency data.
2. Save the extracted data as a CSV file locally.
3. Upload the CSV file to an AWS S3 bucket using the `boto3` library.

## **Page 4: Raw Data Stage**

### **Summary**
This step involves ingesting raw data from the S3 bucket into Snowflake's RAW_STAGE table. We will also configure Snowflake Streams to track incremental updates in the data.

#### **Steps to Implement**
1. Create an external stage in Snowflake pointing to the S3 bucket.
2. Define the RAW_STAGE table schema in Snowflake.
3. Use Snowflake Streams to track changes in the RAW_STAGE table for incremental updates.

## **Page 5: Harmonization & Transformation**

### **Summary**
In this step, we will harmonize and transform raw data into a structured format using Snowpark Python. This involves cleaning, normalizing, and structuring the data into a harmonized table.

#### **Steps to Implement**
1. Use Snowpark Python to read from RAW_STAGE.
2. Apply transformations such as currency normalization and missing value handling.
3. Write the transformed data into a CRYPTO_HARMONIZED table.

## **Page 6: Creating UDFs**

### **Summary**
We will create User-Defined Functions (UDFs) in this step to perform custom operations on our data:
1. A SQL UDF for currency normalization.
2. A Python UDF for calculating volatility.

#### **Steps to Implement**
1. Define SQL UDFs directly in Snowflake for lightweight transformations.
2. Write Python UDFs using Snowpark for complex calculations like volatility analysis.

## **Page 7: Analytics & Aggregation**

### **Summary**
This step focuses on building pre-computed analytics tables that aggregate key metrics (e.g., average volatility, daily price changes). These tables will be used for reporting and analysis.

#### **Steps to Implement**
1. Create an analytics table (CRYPTO_ANALYTICS) in Snowflake.
2. Write stored procedures to update analytics tables periodically.

## **Page 8: Task Orchestration & Automation**

### **Summary**
Automate tasks such as data ingestion, transformation, and analytics updates using:
1. Snowflake Tasks for scheduling workflows within Snowflake.
2. Airflow DAGs for orchestrating external processes.
3. GitHub Actions for CI/CD integration of Snowpark Python code.

#### **Steps to Implement**
1. Define task dependencies using Snowflake Tasks.
2. Create Airflow DAGs to trigger pipeline steps.
3. Set up GitHub Actions workflows for automated deployments.

## **Page 9: Testing & Validation**

### **Summary**
Ensure data quality by writing unit tests for UDFs, stored procedures, and transformations.

#### **Steps to Implement**
1. Write unit tests for SQL UDFs (e.g., currency normalization).
2. Test Python UDFs (e.g., volatility calculations) locally or in a test environment.
3. Validate stored procedures with test datasets.

## **Page 10: Environment Management**

### **Summary**
Use Jinja templates to manage configuration files across DEV/PROD environments efficiently.

#### **Steps to Implement**
1. Create Jinja templates for Snowflake objects (tables, stages).
2. Parameterize configurations like database names or schemas.
3. Render templates dynamically during deployment based on environment variables.
